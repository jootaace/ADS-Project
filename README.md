# ADS-Project
Repository for different versions of ADS Project

UniGuide is a project idea resulting from the group’s collaboration of MESBAHI Chaymae, Juan Carlos JUÁREZ, LOBEFALO Luca, KONAN Ruben, and SVENBURG Alex, AMR Salma. The product idea consists of an application/platform that allows users to connect with like-minded students studying abroad, and getting assistance with either specific courses or life in the new city where they settled. The user would be able to choose one of the following options and decide on either being a Mentor or a Mentee, and then on whether they need assistance with a class subject or with an administrative procedure, by filtering through the menu we provide.
Before the final release, our project will go through different versions before the final software release where the platform that connects the students would be released in the Market. 
Version 0 of the product makes use of Hash Tables, Weighted Graphs, and Dynamic Programming to build the initial version, simulating how the students get matched, filter their preferences, and get instant help with what they need.
